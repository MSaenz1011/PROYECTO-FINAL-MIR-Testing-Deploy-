# **What is Delta Bookings?**

  Delta Bookings is the project we decided to take as part of our
  study plan at Make It Real. It is a fully fledged website we
  developed from the ground up, be it design, front-end and back-end
  functionality, we made it. Of course, it was only possible due to
  the help of our mentors at Make It real, as well as some extra help
  we got along the way.

  So, to answer the question, what is “Delta Bookings”? It is an
  application designed to allow the user to search and book hotel
  reservations all around the world. All the results are filtered by
  city and preferred date.
